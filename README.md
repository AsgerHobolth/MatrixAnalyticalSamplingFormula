# MatrixAnalyticalSamplingFormula
A matrix-analytical sampling formula for the infinite sites model
This README file explains how the R code for calculating the probability of a sample in a population genetic model is organized.

The sampling formula in Hobolth et al (2024) is implemented in step 1-3 below.
Step 1 describes how an evolutionary model is encoded as an object.
Step 2 converts the evolutionary model into a probability model.
Step 3 calculates the probability of a sample for the evolutionary model
